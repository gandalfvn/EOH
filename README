This repository consists the c++ source code that led to the publication of the paper "The evolutionary origins of hierarchy". The program runs on the sferes framework. 
Thus, sferes must be configured and built on your system thought the WAF building system
First, download sferes from   https://github.com/sferes2/sferes2 . To configure sferes run this command (Assuming that sferes is downloaded at /home/$USER/, which is your home directory).

./waf configure --boost-include=/home/$USER/sferes/include/ --boost-libs=/home/$USER/sferes/lib/ --eigen

Then build sferes via
./waf build

Experiments are placed in the folder:  sferes/sferes2/trunk/exp
To compile and run an experiment, run the following command from sferes/sferes2/trunk/: 
./waf --exp NAME_OF_EXPERIMENT

For example to compile the main experiment from “The evolutionary origins of hierarchy paper”, run this command: 
./waf --exp modularity
The executable should be placed in the folder: 
sferes/sferes2/trunk/build/debug/exp/modularity
